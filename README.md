# WiiLetterBomb
 Wii Letterbomb Exploit in a C# WinForm

This is just a direct port in C# of the Python Web based Letterbomb exploit from https://github.com/fail0verflow/letterbomb

Everything is bundled in the WiiLetterBomb.exe so only that executable is required and will put the exploit and HackMii installer (from https://bootmii.org/download) onto your selected drive ready to go.

It also includes a C# built version of the Wii Parental Control password reset tool from: https://wii.marcan.st/parental

All credit goes to the makers of these great tools - I simply built this in about 20 minutes out of curiosity of how the exploit delivery works.
