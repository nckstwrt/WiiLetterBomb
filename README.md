# WiiLetterBomb (for Wii 4.3)
 Wii Letterbomb Exploit in a C# WinForm

This is just a direct port in C# of the Python Web based Letterbomb exploit from https://github.com/fail0verflow/letterbomb

Everything is bundled in the WiiLetterBomb.exe so only that executable is required and will put the exploit and HackMii installer (from https://bootmii.org/download) onto your selected drive ready to go.

It also includes a C# built version of the Wii Parental Control password reset tool from: https://wii.marcan.st/parental

All credit goes to the makers of these great tools - I simply built this in about 20 minutes out of curiosity of how the exploit delivery works.

## Instructions 

This only works on Wii version 4.3. This is the final version of the Wii updates. To upgrade, if necessary, to 4.3 use a game disc from 2011 or later and it will have upgrade your system to 4.3.

You must select the correct region for your Wii for this exploit to work.

To find your MAC address (which is required) on your Wii you can select Wii Settings -> Internet -> Console Information. Enter this address (without the dashes into the tool)

Select your SD card drive and click Write Exploit

After inserting the card back into your Wii, select the Letter icon on the bottom right and then click the arrow to the left to see any messages from the day before. You should see the Letter Bomb icon waiting to run.
